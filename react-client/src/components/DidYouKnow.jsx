	<h2>Paper & Cardboard</h2>

	    <p>Recycled paper produces 73% less air pollution than if it was made from raw materials.

		Approximately 59% of an average cardboard box is recycled material.

	Paper and cardboard  products make up 23.7% of waste in the household bin.

Cardboard boxes can be made up of up to 100% recycled fibres.

		Each ton of recycled paper can save 17 trees, 2.2 cubic metres of landfill space and 7,000 gallons of water.

	35% of the wood harvested worldwide is used to make paper products.

It is possible to recycle one sheet of printer paper up to 7 times.</p>

	<h2>Rigid Plastic</h2>

	    <p>Between 2004 & 2014, the global production of plastics grew from 225 million to 311 million tonnes.

		Producing plastic products from recycled plastics reduces energy requirements by 66%.

		Recycling just 1 tonne of plastics saves  1,000–2,000 gallons of petroleum.

		Plastic drinking bottles can be recycled into duvet fillings, home insulation material, clothing, bin liners, carrier bags, DVD & video game cases, compost bins, park benches, new bottles & much more!

		It takes up to 500 years for  plastic to decompose.

		Almost 8 million metric tonnes of plastic ends up in the world’s oceans every year.</p>


	<h2>Tins & Cans</h2>

	    <p>You can make a bicycle out of 650 recycled aluminium cans.

   	    One recycled drink can save 20 times more energy and emissions than making the can from new materials.

		Recycling uses 5% of the energy needed for primary production.

		If you recycle 1 aluminium can today, it can be made into a new can, get filled and be back on the shelf in just 6 weeks.

		Approximately 75% of the aluminium ever produced is still in circulation today.

		The benefits of recycling aluminium are so great that every effort should be made to divert it from landfill.</p>
