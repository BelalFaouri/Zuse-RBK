	<h2>Paper & Cardboard</h2>
	
	    <p>Recycled paper produces 73% less air pollution than if it was made from raw materials.</p>

		<p>Approximately 59% of an average cardboard box is recycled material.</p>

		<p>Paper and cardboard  products make up 23.7% of waste in the household bin.</p>

		<p>Cardboard boxes can be made up of up to 100% recycled fibres.</p>

		<p>Each ton of recycled paper can save 17 trees, 2.2 cubic metres of landfill space and 7,000 gallons of water.</p>

		<p>35% of the wood harvested worldwide is used to make paper products.</p>

		<p>It is possible to recycle one sheet of printer paper up to 7 times.</p>

	<h2>Rigid Plastic</h2>

	    <p>Between 2004 & 2014, the global production of plastics grew from 225 million to 311 million tonnes.</p>

		<p>Producing plastic products from recycled plastics reduces energy requirements by 66%.</p>

		<p>Recycling just 1 tonne of plastics saves  1,000–2,000 gallons of petroleum.</p>

		<p>Plastic drinking bottles can be recycled into duvet fillings, home insulation material, clothing, bin liners, carrier bags, DVD & video game cases, compost bins, park benches, new bottles & much more!</p>

		<p>It takes up to 500 years for  plastic to decompose.</p>

		<p>Almost 8 million metric tonnes of plastic ends up in the world’s oceans every year.</p>

	
	<h2>Tins & Cans</h2>
	
	    <p>You can make a bicycle out of 650 recycled aluminium cans.</p>

   	    <p>One recycled drink can save 20 times more energy and emissions than making the can from new materials.</p>

		<p>Recycling uses 5% of the energy needed for primary production.</p>

		<p>If you recycle 1 aluminium can today, it can be made into a new can, get filled and be back on the shelf in just 6 weeks.</p>

		<p>Approximately 75% of the aluminium ever produced is still in circulation today.</p>

		<p>The benefits of recycling aluminium are so great that every effort should be made to divert it from landfill.</p>
